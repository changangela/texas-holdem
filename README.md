# Texas Holdem

Texas Holdem is a text-based console game written in C++. Using an object oriented architecture, multiple resuable Cards and Poker game API's were defined providing an easy way for programs to deal and identify the various Poker Hands. Players play against an artificial intelligence function that was designed to mimic human actions of bluffing, calling bluffs, and making statistical predictions.
